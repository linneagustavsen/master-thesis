store windows/grouped data in arrays and do fourier de noiseing on each one 

use https://medium.com/swlh/5-tips-for-working-with-time-series-in-python-d889109e676d

then calculate the mean on the denoised data
 

Then calculate the variance of the mean based on the array (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-statistics-variance/)
variance( [data], xbar= denoised mean )

write both the denoised mean and the variance to a bucket
