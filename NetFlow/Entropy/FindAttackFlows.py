'''
    Calculates entropy and other metrics and write them to file. Also checks if the flow is an attack flow
    Input:  
            silkFile:   string, file with flow records sorted on time
            start:      string, indicating the start time of the data wanted
            stop:       string, indicating the stop time of the data wanted
            systemId:   string, name of the system to collect and calculate on
            frequency:  timedelta object, frequency of metric calculation
            interval:   timedelta object, size of the sliding window which the calculation is made on
            attackDate: string, date of the attack the calculations are made on
